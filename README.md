# Global Trends in Educational Outcomes: A PISA Data Analysis

## Description:
### Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores across OECD countries, focusing on mathematics and science performance among 15-year-old students in 2018 and 2022. Through statistical modeling and data visualization, we explore the relationship between country-specific characteristics and educational outcomes, track changes in performance over time, and identify factors contributing to high achievement levels.

### Objectives
- **Performance Trends Analysis**: Compare math and science scores between 2018 and 2022 to identify global trends in educational outcomes.
- **Impact of Country Characteristics**: Examine how various socioeconomic and environmental factors influence PISA scores, providing insights into the complex interplay between education and national contexts.
- **Predictors of Change**: Model the changes in PISA scores over time to uncover underlying factors that drive improvements or declines in educational performance.
- **High Achievement Analysis**: Investigate the characteristics of countries that achieve high PISA scores, aiming to highlight successful educational strategies and policies.

### Methodology
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Conduct preliminary analysis to understand the structure of the PISA dataset, followed by meticulous data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilize linear and logistic regression models to explore relationships between educational outcomes and country-specific factors. Perform detailed model diagnostics to validate assumptions and refine analysis approaches.
- **Visualizations**: Create intuitive and informative visualizations to illustrate findings, including trends over time, relationships between variables, and comparisons of educational outcomes across countries.

### Key Findings
- Identification of significant predictors of math and science scores, including economic indicators and educational investments.
- Analysis of changes from 2018 to 2022 revealed a significant negative relationship between GDP growth and score changes, suggesting that economic expansion does not directly translate to immediate improvements in educational outcomes.
- Examination of factors contributing to high scores highlighted the marginal significance of population size, indicating complex dynamics between demographic characteristics and educational achievements.

### Implications
This project underscores the importance of holistic approaches to educational policy and investment. By revealing the multifaceted influences on PISA scores, our findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and researchers aiming to enhance educational outcomes worldwide.

## Technologies and Tools
R: Used for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and generating visualizations.

## Future Directions
Future iterations of this project could expand the analysis to include reading scores, explore longitudinal trends across multiple PISA cycles, and incorporate machine learning models to predict educational outcomes based on a broader set of predictors.
